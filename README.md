**Project Objective:**

The objective of this application is to facilitate students and professionals with a digital 
platform/marketplace (in the form of an application) to ease the process of securing a safe and better 
place to live in major cities of Pakistan. Coming from remote areas, it becomes difficult for 
individuals to arrange an accommodation; therefore, we wish to cater their needs. This platform will 
ensure end-to-end verification of tenants and owners, and the objective is to make entire process 
easier, transparent, and cost-effective. This application will allow following tasks: 


**Key Features:**

➢ Tenants (students and professionals) may create their unique IDs on the application. Before 
account activation, their credentials will be verified from the set of provided documents. 

➢ Tenants will be able to search properties according to their preferences and filters, such as 
location, accommodation type, rent range, nearby landmarks, etc. 

➢ Property owners may create their unique IDs, before uploading property details for rent. 
Owners’ details along with that of their property will be verified via documents and physical 
visit by support team. 

➢ Tenants may book the accommodation as per availability and consent from the respective 
owner. 

➢ Both parties will be obliged to reach an e-agreement (duly vetted) before payment exchange 
happens. 

➢ Tenants will have the option to pay online.

➢ Both tenants and owners may reach out to Support Team via app for any queries or 
complaints. 

➢ The parties can keep a track record under the unique IDs.
